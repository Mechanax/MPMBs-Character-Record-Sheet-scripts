np) = nitpick (Just little gripes I had while working with the class), can mostly be ignored
e) = error (something that needs fixing or clarification) ex. a typo
s) = suggestion (something that I think would improve the understandability of the class)

Revised Artificer -
	Features
		Specialization Upgrade
e)			typo: "Only the Artificer selecting the upgrade use the upgrade"
													       ^("can")

Revised Artificer end -

Cannonsmith -
e)	At the bottom of page 5 it says "Revised Artificer v1.3" and it looks like their is two 5s for the page number. But that might just be the picture

	Upgrades
		typo in Blast Radius title 
e)			Prerequisite is spelled wrong

Gadgetsmith -
	Essential Tools: Gadgetsmith Weapon vs. Gadgetsmith Upgrades
e)		Repeating Crossbow or Repeating Hand Crossbow

	Upgrades
s)		Add weights for weapon upgrades or some reason why they don't have weights
		(Realistically, all the gadget upgrades should have weights, 
		but I like the idea of the Gadgetsmith having some reason for them not to)

e)		"Nimble Gloves" are incompatible with "Gripping Gloves" but not vice-versa

e)		typo in Airburst Mine desc					   v
			"to be triggered by your reaction within a 1 minute"
		
e)		What is used to activate Element Eater. I assume it's a reaction to taking elemental damage?

e)		Lightning Baton
			Is the +1/+2 to both damage dies or just one, if just one, which one

s)		As much as I love it, Bee Swarm Rockets seems a little overpowered at earlier levels 
			30d6 (avg 105) is a lot of damage at lv 15, single target or spread out
			even half (52-ish) is a lot, it's also guaranteed aoe damage, with no counter
			40d6 at lv 20 seems fine but I feel like it starts to high
			maybe make it 1d6 per, up to 2d6 at lv 17
			or just make it a lv 17 pre-requirement like lv 9 spells
			(Then again Force Cage is a lv 7 spell so maybe it's not that bad)

Potionsmith -
	Upgrades
e)		Typo in Fortifying Fumes Reaction
			"The both the temporary hit points and damage bonus"
			  ^

Potionsmith end -

Warsmith -
e)	typo in Mechplate feature desc
		"in a process takes 1000 gold pieces and eight hours."
			    	 ^("that")
				  
	Upgrades
s)		Arcane Visor
			The "using your spell save DC" line is not needed as nether spell uses the spell save DC

s)		Energy Surge
			Might want to add a minimum number of usages per long rest to this, incase of a negative Int mod

s)		Projectors and Capacitors
			There is only 2 of each, it doesn't really need to say "Incompatible with other projectors"
			It can just say "Incompatible with Lightning Projector" for example
			It's a little more clear that way. Same thing for Capacitors

e)		Typo in Power Fist            
			"Your Mechplate gauntlet's is upgraded to a magical weapon"
            ^("One of ")            ^(remove)
						 
np)		Sentient Armor
			"The bonus your Mechplate grants to your Intelligence score and maximum Intelligence score increases by 1 while wearing this armor"
			Unless I'm mistaken this is the first and only ability that ups Int and max Int
			This seems to imply that it should already have a bonus to increase
